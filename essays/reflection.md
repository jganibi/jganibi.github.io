  - E09: Reflect on Javascript 1

Other than a few differences with syntax, Javascript seems to be much easier than C++ so far, I haven't experienced a language this simple since Python. The past practice modules have shown that Javascript is more flexible than any language I've practiced before, with declarers such as "let" and "const" instead of having to specifically declare the type of variables. I also appreciate that I don't have to declare the type of a function, and have ways of distinguishing types through "==" and "===" comparisons. I believe this flexibility makes Javascript a reliable and useful language for software engineers.

I just learned about the Fibonacci sequence last semester, yet I needed the second Project Euler problem to remind me about it. The only stressful part about the practice WODs was the time limit. I tend to obssess over solving the problem quickly rather than solving it correctly, but this risk will be mitigated through practice and repitition. Other than that, athletic software engineering is worth the demanding workload and is as enjoyable as it is stressful.
