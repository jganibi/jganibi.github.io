I never had a passion for anything more specific than the plain action of thinking. Seriously, I don't even enjoy asking questions or being asked about my thoughts, this passion is completely self-centered and self-directed. It can be exhilarating to finally learn something new; the realization that looking into outer space with a telescope is a look into the past, practicing the latest viral dance move, the thrills of a new language are a few of the things that spontaneously combust my mind. 

As a young adult, I became obssessed with becoming multilingual. The patterns and similarities I noticed within the Italian, Spanish, and French languages stimulated a drive in me to do more drills and speak in longer sentences. However, my practice felt more purposeful than reading and writing. There was a formula, a certain algorithm for each sentence of variables. Each word in English maps to a translation in another language. Given an input array of strings (the sentence), acquire translations for each object and rearrange into a sentence according to the desired language:

It probably seems weird to you and that's understandable; it's also weird to me. Weird, most times challenging, but with a purpose. This is just my way of coping with my lack of experience in my strongest interests. Though I have no prior experience with the software or engineering involved, I tend to try thinking about topics such as missile defense and cybersecurity. Since I am working on Computer Vision, I'm hoping to experience software involving heat detection, an important utility in missile defense. If I don't develop the skills necessary to work in national defense in school, I will do everything I can to figure them out at home.
